# Astro Starter

This is a starter example for [Astro](https://astro.build), deployed with [Begin](https://begin.com).

## Deploy your own

[![Deploy to Begin](https://static.begin.com/deploy-to-begin.svg)](https://begin.com/apps/create?template=https://github.com/begin-examples/astro-starter)

Deploy your own clone of this app to Begin!

## Getting started

### Project setup

Using Node.js v14.x (AWS Lambda default) and npm 7

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the local Astro dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running.

You can also test out the built version locally by building your Astro site with:

```sh
npm run build # an alias for astro build
```

Then run the Architect Sandbox with

```sh
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) to see how Sandbox serves static assets from the `./dist` directory.

## Deploy to Begin

When your main branch on GitHub is updated, Begin will build your Astro site and deploy the static assets directly.
